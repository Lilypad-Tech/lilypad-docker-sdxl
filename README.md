# SDXL Pipeline for Lilypad and Docker 🐋
This is a special branch used for managing access to specific Lilypad modules.

The special branches are named as follows:

* sdxl-0.9-base
* sdxl-0.9-refiner
* sdxl-1.0-base
* sdxl-0.9-refiner

You'll want to look at the `main` branch if you want the proper README.

Thanks for checking out Lilypad!
